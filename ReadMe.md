## Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for uplift modeling using Python, with a focus on the causalML package and other classic machine learning libraries. Uplift modeling is a technique used to identify the individuals most likely to respond positively to a treatment or intervention.

## Project Structure
The project consists of a Jupyter notebook that walks through the entire uplift modeling process, from data generation to model evaluation and selection.
